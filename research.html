				Phonocardiogram (PCG) signal is used for the early detection of cardiovascular diseases as it captures the heart sound characteristics. 
				In this paper, a spectral attention based deep-learning network is proposed for the automatic detection of cardiac disease from the spectrograms of PCG 
				signals, namely SpectroCardioNet. From a given PCG audio signal, in view of simultaneously utilizing both time and frequency domain information, 
				spectrogram, delta-spectrogram and double-delta-spectrogram are generated. The extracted triple-spectrogram representation is applied in the proposed 
				network as a three-channel 2D input, where it passes spectral and sequential feature paths. In the spectral feature path, a spectral attention block is 
				designed to emphasizes some regions in the spectrograms based on a deep attention network and its output is then processed through the spectral pattern 
				detectors. On the other hand, in order to extract the temporal behavior of the frequency components of the spectrograms, 1D convolution based sequential 
				feature extractor is also proposed. Extensive experimentation is carried out on two standard PCG datasets and a very satisfactory performance is achieved 
				in comparison to that obtained by some existing methods.

				We introduce, SHONGLAP, a large annotated open-domain dialogue corpus in Bengali language. 
				Due to unavailability of high-quality dialogue datasets for low-resource languages like Bengali, existing neural open-domain dialogue systems suffers 
				from data scarcity. We propose a framework to prepare large-scale open-domain dialogue dataset from publicly available multi-party discussion podcasts, 
				talk-shows and label them based on weak-supervision techniques which is particularly suitable for low-resource languages. Using the framework, we 
				prepared our corpus which is the first reported Bengali open-domain dialogue corpus, which can serve as a strong baseline for future works. 
				Experimental results show that use of our corpus improve performance of large language models (BanglaBERT) to do downstream classification tasks during 
				fine-tuning.

				Surafce electromyography (sEMG) sensor is a
				non-invasive diagnostic tool for identifying muscle diseases
				which is also utilized in portable smart devices to recognize
				body mass compositions. In this article, we propose a novel
				pixelated electrode array that can modulate electrode size and
				leverage natural filtering property of electrodes to maximize
				the signal-to-noise ratio in different body locations and
				for individuals with varied skin features and composition.
				While determining the ideal electrode layout, the suggested
				concept significantly reduces the signal sample duration and
				is able to avoid additional computational overhead once
				the optimal arrangement is identified. Moreover, it offers
				a substantial advantage over traditional signal processing
				techniques, which need constant processing to filter out noise
				and improve the intelligent signal with digital filters and
				transceiver amplifiers. Because of truncated processing cost,
				the proposed array is suitable for wearable devices driven
				with low-power embedded microcontrollers, where high
				computational requirement often prove to be prohibitive.

				Rapid and precise diagnosis of COVID-19 is
				one of the major challenges faced by the global community
				to control the spread of this overgrowing pandemic. In this
				article, a hybrid neural network is proposed, named CovTANet, to provide an end-to-end clinical diagnostic tool for
				early diagnosis, lesion segmentation, and severity prediction of COVID-19 utilizing chest computer tomography (CT)
				scans. A multiphase optimization strategy is introduced for
				solving the challenges of complicated diagnosis at a very
				early stage of infection, where an efficient lesion segmentation network is optimized initially, which is later integrated
				into a joint optimization framework for the diagnosis and
				severity prediction tasks providing feature enhancement of
				the infected regions. Moreover, for overcoming the challenges with diffused, blurred, and varying shaped edges
				of COVID lesions with novel and diverse characteristics,
				a novel segmentation network is introduced, namely trilevel attention-based segmentation network. This network
				has significantly reduced semantic gaps in subsequent
				encoding–decoding stages, with immense parallelization of
				multiscale features for faster convergence providing considerable performance improvement over traditional networks. Furthermore, a novel tri-level attention mechanism
				has been introduced, which is repeatedly utilized over the
				network, combining channel, spatial, and pixel attention.

				Social media platforms have become one of the primary mediums of communication nowadays. 
				Along with communication, they are currently being utilized in a wide range of activities like digital marketing, customer care, e-learning etc. 
				The unceasing use of social media is generating gigantic amount of textual data everyday. 
				It is essential to properly analyze these data with the consideration of underlying human traits sentiments for exploring the full potential of these 
				platforms. However, sentiment analysis from text has been considered as a challenging task because of the rapid use of informal and noisy words. 
				Updated and powerful word embeddings are being invented almost every two years so that the machines could understand the underlying features 
				of linguistics. Each of these embedding techniques excel in different aspects. In this paper, we present a novel RNN based sentiment polarity 
				detection framework which feeds the power of three different word embeddings: Word2Vec, GloVe and SSWE into a single powerful network with three
				parallel branches. The proposed network effectively utilizes the semantic, syntactic and sentiment polarity wise embeddings in word vectors encoding 
				three major aspect of language from the viewpoint of extracting sentiment information from text. Posts collected from twitter was used to train and 
				validate the proposed network. The results demonstrate that the proposed network containing parallelly configured multiple word embeddings outperforms 
				the single word vectorization techniques. Additionally, it shows comparable or better evaluation scores when compared to several contemporary 
				state-of-the-art models.

						Derailment is a significant problem in the rail system in developing and underdeveloped countries. Derailment can occur for 
						number of reasons. For example, natural disasters or unethical activities by human. However, a complete detection system for 
						derailment is yet unavailable in the market. Our approach focuses on developing such a system that can sense the vibrations 
						of the railtrack and can detect whether there is a derailment within a certain range of the track.
