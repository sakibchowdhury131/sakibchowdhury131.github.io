						Our team was champion in the competition. We utilized Image Processing Techniques
						to determine the shape of objects on a running conveyor belt while a robotic arm kept
						sorting objects. Later, the project was also showcased on "Digital Bangladesh 2017". Details of the project can be found <a href="https://github.com/sakibchowdhury131/Industrial-Automation-Challenge-2017.git">here</a>.

                This project is a part of my learning GAN for the first time. It was trained on 200 images of my own face. Extremely small dataset, right? ;3 <br>
				Implemented this on google colab. This picture depicts the output of the training after 10000 epochs.
				Performance is not decent. But the shape of the face can be recognized. :3

                This project is the design of a vehicle tracking system. This hardware is connected to several sensors: voltage measurement, current measurement, accelerometer, GPS and bluetooth. It is connected to 
				the internet through GSM technology. It directly pushes data to google firebase through MQTT communication. <br>
				Users can integrate this device with their vehicles to monitor and track the movement, voltage level etc of their vehicles.
				The driver APK file can be found here: <a href="https://github.com/sakibchowdhury131/TrackMe_VTS">here</a>. <br>
				The schematic files can be found here: <a href="https://oshwlab.com/sakibchowdhury131/gps_tracker_v2-0#P4">here</a>. <br><br>

				<li><h2><a href="#">4 Bit SAP Computer</a></h2></li>
				<br>
				
                This <a href="https://github.com/sakibchowdhury131/SAP_4BIT_VERILOG">repository</a> is the design of a 4 Bit SAP computer designed in VERILOG HDL. Total 16 instructions were implemented. 
				<br>
				<p>
					4 Bit Computer in Verilog [SAP]<br>
					- Instruction Set:<br>
						- Add A, B <br>
						- Sub A, B<br>
						- XCHG B, A<br>
						- mov B, [address]<br>
						- out B<br>
						- jnz Address<br>
						- RCR A<br>
						- mov B, BYTE<br>
						- jmp Address<br>
						- push A<br>
						- pop A<br>
						- CALL Addr<br>
						- RET<br>
						- xor A, [Addr]<br>
						- test B, BYTE<br>
						- HLT<br>

					This computer is designed in such a fashion so that all the instructions are executed sequentially.
					The instruction pointer for the next instruction is passed at the end of each instruction.<br>

					# Instruction 1: ADD A, B<br>
					In the first clock cycle, we observe the completion of the add operation which adds the values
					stored in register A and B and saves the calculated result in the register A.<br>
					# Instruction 2: SUB A,B<br>
					In the next instruction, A - B operation is performed. The result is stored in register C. Later the
					value stored in C is copied to A and the value in C is overwritten with 0.<br>
					# Instruction 3: XCHG B, A<br>
					In this case, the value of A is temporarily stored in register C and later the value of B is copied to
					register A. Now value stored in B can be replaced with the register value of C to complete the
					operation.<br>
					# Instruction 4: mov B, [address]<br>
					In this case, we are looking at the memory location pointed by the pointer ‘address’. Garbage
					values are stored in the MEM at the beginning of the code. So the memory address pointed by the
					‘address’ pointer will be copied to register B.<br>
					# Instruction 5: OUT B<br>
					The value of B is passed to the output buffer OUTPORT.<br>
					# Instruction 6: JNZ address<br>
					This instruction checks whether the zero flag holds a nonzero value or not. If it holds a nonzero
					value the value of the Instruction pointer will be changed to the instruction address pointed by the
					pointer ‘address’.<br>
					# Instruction 7: RCR A<br>
					This instruction rotates the value stored in register A in the right direction and holds it temporarily in
					register C. In this case, the carry bit is also associated with the shift operation.<br>
					# Instruction 8: MOV B, BYTE<br>
					In this instruction, values stored in BYTE will be copied to the register B.<br>
					# Instruction 9: JMP Address<br>
					In this instruction, the address pointed by address is stored to the instruction pointer so that in the
					next clock cycle, the pointed instruction is executed.<br>
					# Instruction 10: PUSH A<br>
					The value of A is saved to the stack memory at the location pointed by the stack pointer. The value
					of stack pointer is increased by one so that if another push command is executed, the new value is
					stored at the next memory location of the stack memory.<br>
					# Instruction 11: POP A<br>
					The value saved in the stack memory is retrieved and saved to the register A. before doing this
					operation the value of stack pointer is decreased by one so that it fetches the last saved value from
					the stack memory.<br>
					# Instruction 12: Call Address<br>
					In this case, current instruction pointer value is stored to the stack memory and the value of
					instruction pointer is set to the value pointed by Address.<br>
					# Instruction 13: RET<br>
					Returns to the last instruction pointer saved previously in the stack memory.<br>
					# Instruction 14: xor A, [address]<br>
					The value stored in the memory address pointed by the ‘address’ pointer, is xored by the value
					stored in the register A. The result is temporarily saved in register C. Later this value is moved to
					the register A.<br>
					# Instruction 15: TEST B, BYTE<br>
					This instruction performs AND operation between B and BYTE but discards the result. It only
					updates the flags based on the result .<br>
					# Instruction 16: HLT<br>
					This instruction sets the HLT flag indicating the end of the code.<br>
